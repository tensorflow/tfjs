/**
 * MultiHeadAttention layer with cache support.
 *
 * This layer is suitable for use in autoregressive decoding. It can be use
 * to cache decoder self-attention and cross-attention. The forward pass
 * can happen in one of three modes:
 * - No cache, same as regular multi-head attention.
 * - Static cache (`cacheUpdateIndex` is None). In this case, the
 *     cached key/value projections will be used and the input values will
 *     be ignored.
 * - Updated cache (`cacheUpdateIndex` is not None). In this case, new
 *     key/value projections are computed using the input, and spliced into
 *     the cache at the specified index.
 *
 * Note that caching is useful only during inference and should not be used
 * during training.
 *
 * We use the notation `B`, `T`, `S` below, where `B` is the batch dimension,
 * `T` is the target sequence length, and `S` in the source sequence length.
 * Note that during generative decoding, `T` is usually 1 (you are
 * generating a target sequence of length one to predict the next token).
 *
 * Returns:
 *     An `(attentionOutput, cache)` tuple. `attentionOutput` is the result
 *     of the computation, of shape `(B, T, dim)`, where `T` is for target
 *     sequence shapes and `dim` is the query input last dimension if
 *     `outputShape` is `null`. Otherwise, the multi-head outputs are
 *     projected to the shape specified by `outputShape`. `cache` is the
 *     updated cache.
