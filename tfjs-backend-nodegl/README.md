# Headless WebGL backend for TensorFlow.js via Node.js

** This project is under heavy development **

This new backend will provide a light-weight headless WebGL runtime for TensorFlow.js running under Node.js. This new backend is powered by the [node-gles](https://github.com/google/node-gles) module which uses [ANGLE](https://github.com/google/angle) to provide an integration layer to system GL runtime. This package aims to provide a think acceleration engine for IoT, desktop, and Node.js applications where CUDA (size/OS compatibility) is not an option.
