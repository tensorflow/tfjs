# TensorFlow.js: Union Package

A part of the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) ecosystem,
TensorFlow.js is a library for web browser-based machine learning using
JavaScript or TypeScript. It enables building, loading, executing and training
machine learning models in the browser, powered by WebGL acceleration.

This repository contains the logic and scripts to form a **union** package,
[@tensorflowjs/tfjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow/tfjs), from

- [TensorFlow.js Core](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-core),
  a flexible low-level API, formerly known as *deeplearn.js*.
- [TensorFlow.js Layer](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-layers),
  a high-level API modeled after [Keras](https://keras.io/).

For more information on the APIs, follow the links to their respective
repositories, or visit [js.tensorflow.org](https://js.tensorflow.org).
