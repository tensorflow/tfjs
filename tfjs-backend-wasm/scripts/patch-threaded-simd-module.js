/**
 * This file patches the Emscripten-generated WASM JS script so that it can be
 * properly loaded in web worker.
 *
 * We need to pass the content of this script to WASM module's
 * mainScriptUrlOrBlob field so that the web worker can correctly load the
 * script "inline". The returned content of the script (after it self-executes)
 * is a anonymous function object in which we have the following if block:
 *
 * if (_scriptDir) {
 *   scriptDirectory = _scriptDir;
 * }
 *
 * It works great if the script runs in the main page, where _scriptDir is
 * initialized to the path of the tf-backend-wasm.js file, outside of the
 * function object. However, when the script runs in a web worker, the
 * code that initializes _scriptDir won't be present since it is outside
 * of the scope of the function object. As a result, a "Uncaught
 * ReferenceError: _scriptDir is not defined" error will be thrown fron
 * the web worker.
 *
 * To fix this, we will replace all the occurences of "if(_scriptDir)"
 * with a better version that first checks whether _scriptDir is defined
 * or not
 *
 * For more context, see:
 * https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/pull/12832
