# TensorFlow.js Example: Multivariate Linear Regression for browser

This example shows you how to perform linear regression with tfjs-data API using [Boston Housing Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/boston/bostonDetail.html) which is a famous dataset derived from information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston Mass.

Prepare the environment:
```sh
$ npm install
# Or
$ yarn
```

Temporary (before we move to tfjs-examples):
```sh
cd ../../
yarn publish-local
cd demo/boston-housing
yarn link-local @tensorflow/tfjs-data
```
