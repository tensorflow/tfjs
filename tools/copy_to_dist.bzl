    Preserves relative paths between linked files. A common root path of the
    input files can be removed via the 'root' arg.

    This rule is used to 'copy' the results of compiling a tfjs package's
    sources located in 'src' to the output directory 'dist' while preserving
    the filetree's relative paths. The benifit of using this rule is that Bazel
    is aware of the copied files and can use them in other rules like 'pkg_npm'.
    It is also used for copying tfjs bundles and miniprogram outputs.
